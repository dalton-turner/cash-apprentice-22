## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a central location for all of the learning resources that are gathered during the apprenticeship program. This repository will be maintained by the apprenticeship program mentors, administrators, and alumni. It will be updated with new resources as they are found. 

## Apprentice Program

The Cash App Software Engineering Apprentice Program is a 6-month initiative designed to give Block employees with little to no professional software engineering experience the opportunity to learn the skills necessary to become an entry-level professional Software Engineer on the job.
